# Particle_Collision
This is an old learning project done in Processing. Uploaded from an archive (files have been reformatted or rewritten)
This is a naive implementation that brute forces all collision checks O(n^2). For a more robust implementation using an acceleration structure I should have a more recent repo. 

Rendering and PhysicsTicks are in fact separate (rendering happens at 120Hz, while physics happens at 60Hz). So at least there's that :)
